Multi-Dataset DEG Analysis and Functional Enrichment

This repository contains R scripts and outputs for differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, functional enrichment, 
and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis across multiple GEO datasets related to neural differentiation 
and neurodegeneration.
